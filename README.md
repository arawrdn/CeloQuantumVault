# CeloQuantumVault
CeloQuantumVault is a decentralized vault on the Celo mainnet where users can deposit CELO/cUSD into a vault without knowing exact outcomes. The vault uses pseudo-random on-chain logic influenced by blockchain events (block hash, timestamp, or other deposits) to distribute rewards. Itâ€™s a gamified staking experiment combining chance and strategy.
